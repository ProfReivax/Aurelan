Marcherion is ruled not by kings or nobles, but by the **[[Iron Concord]]**, a council of thirteen representatives drawn from the city’s most powerful mercenary companies and merchant guilds. In theory, the Concord exists to guide and protect the city. In practice, it sometimes seems as if it serves only itself.

For over a century and a half, the Concord has acted purely for the benefit of its members — brokering exclusive contracts, skimming tariffs, and granting themselves lucrative monopolies. The last major public work attributed to them dates back **160 years**: the founding of the **University of Marcherion**, established under an idealistic City Marshal who dreamed of raising the city above blood and coin. He was swiftly deposed — some say murdered — for his ideals.

Since then, no true civic institution has been built by the council. The **temples**, **covered markets**, and **residential districts** that now define the city were all founded by the people themselves: craftsmen, guilds, and mercenaries who decided to shape their own destiny rather than wait for permission from those in power. In Marcherion, the saying _“If you want something, forge it yourself”_ isn’t advice — it’s a creed.

The **City Marshal**, elected every three years from among the Concord’s ranks, is little more than a figurehead. Real influence comes from fear, gold, or the ability to rally allies through force of will. Those who have tried to reform the system tend to vanish soon after, usually in “honorable duels” no one dares to question.
