#### **Legacy and Influence**

Though Kael Marcher has been dead for over a century, his spirit and vision remain woven into the very fabric of Marcherion. When he founded the city 156 years ago, he was already an old man — battle-scarred and wise beyond his years. He poured decades of experience, strength, and leadership into building a sanctuary where merit ruled over birthright and ambition drove progress.

His towering statue still dominates **[[The Concord Market]]**, sword raised toward the horizon, symbolizing unyielding resolve and the city’s origins in defiance and freedom. His teachings and ideals continue to guide Marcherion’s mercenaries and citizens alike, a constant reminder of what it means to live by strength, honor, and one’s own word.

#### **Brief Biography**

Kael was born in the kingdom of **[[Vhaloria]]**, where he rose to prominence as a seasoned general fighting alongside [[Ael'Nathra]] in [[The Long Tear]]. As [[The Empire]] swept through [[Vhaloria]], annexing it under iron rule, Kael—then an elder warrior—refused to accept subjugation. He gathered his loyal war comrades and their families, leading them to establish a new city-state where survival depended on skill and steel, not titles or bloodlines.

Kael ruled [[Marcherion]] for the few decades after its founding, guiding its early growth and securing its independence amid warring powers. He passed away peacefully in his later years, leaving behind a legacy that would shape the city’s identity for generations.
