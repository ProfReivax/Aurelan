### **Description:**

Justice is the unwavering balance that holds society together — the impartial scale weighing action and consequence, right and wrong, truth and deception. It is neither mercy nor cruelty but the principle that all must answer for their choices, and that fairness is the foundation upon which peace endures.

Followers of Justice believe that every action has a place in the grand ledger, and that no favor or bias should cloud the path of equity. Justice is a living force that breathes in law, custom, and conscience, binding communities and individuals alike with invisible chains of responsibility.

Temples dedicated to Justice stand as bastions of order — austere yet solemn, often adorned with balanced scales, unyielding pillars, and blindfolded eyes carved in stone. The faithful serve as arbiters, judges, and mediators, seeking truth and ensuring that balance prevails.



### **Tenets of Equitable Balance:**

1. **Uphold Fairness:** Treat all beings with impartiality, regardless of status or circumstance.

2. **Seek Truth:** Pursue honesty in word and deed, for justice cannot be served where deception thrives.

3. **Bear Responsibility:** Accept the consequences of your actions without evasion or excuse.

4. **Defend the Innocent:** Protect those who cannot defend themselves and speak for the voiceless.

5. **Balance Mercy and Retribution:** Justice requires neither cruelty nor leniency unchecked — temper judgement with wisdom.

### **Afterlife — The Hall of Echoes**

> _“When the breath ceases, the deeds endure.”_

Those who follow Justice believe that after death, souls enter the **Hall of Echoes** — a vast, timeless chamber lined with mirrors that reflect the life and choices of the departed. Here, the god of Justice weighs each soul against their actions, not to punish, but to understand the truth of their journey.

The faithful believe that souls found balanced and true are granted peace, while those whose deeds are tangled in dishonesty or cruelty may linger, facing echoes of their own conscience until equilibrium is restored.

The Hall of Echoes is not a place of torment but of reckoning — a final step toward cosmic balance and, ultimately, the restoration of order in the great design.
