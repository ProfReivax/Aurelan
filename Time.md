### **Description:**

Time is the eternal weaver of moments, the creator and guardian of the great river that carries past, present, and future in endless motion. This god crafted time long ago, setting its currents into motion and watching over its ceaseless flow ever since. Time is neither friend nor foe—it simply **is**: impartial, fluid, and infinitely complex.

Followers honor Time as both the sacred current of existence and the domain of those who seek to understand and, when wise, shape it. Time’s flow may be studied, navigated, and gently guided; to master its secrets is a great responsibility. Yet all must respect its depth, for even the smallest ripple may echo through eternity.

Temples dedicated to Time are filled with symbols of cycles and endlessness: intricate clocks, spirals, hourglasses, and mirrors reflecting countless moments. The faithful serve as historians, seers, and guardians of forgotten lore, entrusted with preserving the past and illuminating the path ahead.

### **Afterlife — The Hall of Endless Clocks**

> _“When the final moment fades, the soul steps into the infinite weave.”_

The faithful believe that after death, souls enter the **Hall of Endless Clocks** — a vast, timeless chamber where every moment of existence ticks in perfect harmony. Here, the god of Time records and preserves each life’s span as part of the eternal pattern.

Souls are neither punished nor rewarded but are integrated into the infinite flow, their essence becoming part of the timeless cycle. Some legends speak of souls granted the honor to become **Chronicle Guardians**, ethereal beings who watch over time’s unbroken path.

The Hall is a place of stillness and movement simultaneously — a realm where seconds stretch and collapse, and the past, present, and future intertwine. It is the ultimate sanctuary for those who respect the sacred nature of time’s unyielding march.
