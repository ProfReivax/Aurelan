## **Appearance**  
A tall man with a solid build, nearing his forties, Garran has skin tanned by sun and wind, and grey-blue eyes marked with the weariness of someone who has seen too much.  
His brown hair, streaked with ashen strands, is loosely tied behind his head. His armor, though reliable, bears the scars of many battles. His lute, reinforced with metal plates and stained with dried blood, is a true relic of the battlefield.  
When he sings, his voice carries the roughness of campfire smoke and the weight of a man who has buried far too many companions.

## **Personality**  
**Voice:** Deep, steady, and measured — every word feels chosen, never wasted.  
**Attitude:** Stoic but warm; he rarely smiles, but when he does, it is sincere.  
**Habits:** Polishes his weapon as much as his horn; hums military hymns while sharpening his blade.  
**Quirk:** Measures time in “march beats” rather than seconds.

---
## **Motivation & Inner Conflict**  
Once a war hero, Garran now walks the path of redemption. He sings so the dead will not be forgotten, and to remind himself that courage only has meaning when paired with compassion.  
He no longer fights for kings — only for those who cannot protect themselves.

## **Origin**

vient d'une nation qui fait maintenant partie de l'empire, côtière à l'est, parent y résident encore et possèdent un bateau de pêche. 




## **Combat Style**  
**Role in combat:** A front-line support fighter, battling alongside his allies, shouting orders and chants amid the clash of steel.  
**Weapons:** Favors the longsword or the warhammer he carries on his back; his shield, engraved with faded musical notes, pays tribute to every fallen comrade.  
**Signature technique:** _The Ballad of Iron and Ash_ — Garran strikes his sword against his shield, unleashing a thunderous chord that rekindles his allies’ resolve.

---
## **Performance Style**  
When Garran plays, it is not to entertain — but to remember. His songs blend war chants, funeral laments, and raw percussive rhythms.  
He often strikes his lute with his metal-gloved hand to make it resonate with metallic sounds, echoing the marching steps of troops.  
Among his known pieces: _The Dawn’s Last Watch_, _Ashes in the Rain_, and _The Iron-String March_.

## **Lost Companions**
### 1. Captain [[Arel Thorne]] — _“The Iron Dawn”_
**Role:** Garran’s commanding officer  
**Personality:** Stern but fair; strategic mind with the heart of a guardian.  
**Bond with Garran:** Arel was the one who first heard Garran sing around a campfire and insisted he carry those songs into battle as a beacon for others. He treated Garran less as a subordinate and more as a younger brother.  
**How they died (officially):** Arel fell during a last stand against a superior force, covering the retreat of civilians. His body was never recovered.  
**Legacy:** His shield is the first one Garran etched music notes onto. Arel’s rumored survival is Garran’s strongest unfinished thread — a hope he fears to believe in.

### **2. [[Serana Vell]]** — _“The Laughing Blade”_
**Role:** Scout and front-line skirmisher  
**Personality:** Warm, irreverent, always joking — the light of the unit.  
**Bond with Garran:** Serana helped Garran cope with the heaviness of war. She teased him into smiling, challenged him to duels he always lost, and composed silly verses to counterbalance his somber ballads.  
**How they died:** Ambushed while scouting ahead, Serana bought the company time by fighting to the last breath. Garran was the one who found her body.  
**Legacy:** Garran’s piece _Ashes in the Rain_ is secretly her elegy. He never performs it without faltering slightly on the final chord.

### **3. [[Dorn Halvek]]** — _“The Hammerborn”_
**Role:** Heavy infantry and Garran’s battlefield partner  
**Personality:** Loyal, blunt, disciplined — a man of few but honest words.  
**Bond with Garran:** Dorn and Garran fought shoulder-to-shoulder for years. Dorn was the one who taught Garran to measure time in march-beats. He encouraged Garran to sing louder in battle, insisting it kept the unit’s hearts steady.  
**How they died:** Dorn sacrificed himself to shield Garran and two wounded soldiers from a collapsing fortification during a siege.  
**Legacy:** Garran carries Dorn’s warhammer on his back. Every dent and scratch on it is left untouched — a part of Dorn preserved.
 

## **Companions**

### **[[Lyrin Vael]]** — _“Saltwhisper”_

**Role:** Former war scout and logistics officer; now a contract specialist in **The Iron Scribes**.  
**Personality:** Dry wit, calm, perceptive — a woman who reads people as easily as maps.  
**Bond with Garran:** Childhood acquaintance turned war comrade. They stood watch together through some of the worst nights of the coastal campaigns. Lyrin was the first to call him _Windpipes_ and often kept him steady when grief threatened to drown him.  
**How they survived:** Lyrin left the frontlines crippled by guilt after orchestrating the supply route that led their unit into the ambush where Serana died. She now works in administration to ensure no one suffers from bad information again.  
**Legacy:** She shares an apartment with Garran, quietly watches his back, and sometimes “misplaces” early-contract drafts on the kitchen table for him to find — the last thread of loyalty to their fallen friends.
