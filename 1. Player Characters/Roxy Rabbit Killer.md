## **Motivation & Inner Conflict**

She carries the lingering fear that attachments lead to loss. Taken from K’Sharrah at eight years old, shaped into a scout for a kingdom that was not hers, she learned to survive by severing ties before they could hurt her.

Since joining the Iron Ravens, she has found purpose — but not yet belonging. She wants to protect information, friends, and fragile moments of peace… yet cannot shake the belief that everything she holds will eventually be taken.

Her struggle is simple and brutal:  
**Does she dare build a life, knowing it could be stolen again?**

## **Origin**

Born in **K’Sharrah**, the sweeping savannah province of the Empire, she was raised among wide horizons, warm winds, and the vibrant traditions of the Thérionides. At eight years old, during the **War of the Three Crowns**, she was captured by Ael’Nathran soldiers and transported across the border.

For six years she survived as a displaced child-scout — learning to track, hide, and listen. By fourteen, she was fighting for a nation she didn’t choose.

When the war ended, she slipped away and eventually crossed paths with the Iron Ravens in Marcherion. They did not ask for her past — only for her promise of silence and precision.

### **Belief in Luck**

She does not pray often, and she does not claim any deep understanding of divine matters. But she carries small habits — tapping a doorframe twice before entering, tying a red thread around her left wrist before missions, whispering a quick thanks when danger passes. To her, **Luck is not a god to worship, but a companion she refuses to take for granted**.  
After all, the world has taken much from her — but Luck, at least, has let her live.

## Companions

### **[[Serevin “Greyquill” Marrow]]** — _“The Quiet Talon”_

**Role:** Senior Shadowwatcher; head of internal field training  
**Age:** 48
**Personality:** Soft-spoken, razor-sharp, and dryly humorous; has a talent for seeing what people refuse to admit about themselves.  
**Reputation:** One of the Iron Ravens’ most reliable “ghosts.” He knows Marcherion’s rooftops, alleys, blind spots, and political shadows better than almost anyone. If Corven Draal is the mind of the Ravens, Serevin is its silent intuition.  

**Bond with Your Character:**  
Serevin was the first Raven who truly understood her. He recognized her quiet trauma, her instincts, and the way she disappeared into silence not out of habit, but out of fear of being seen. Rather than pushing her, he simply offered small lessons — how to read a rooftop like a battlefield, how to vanish from a crowd without rushing, how to let silence be a tool rather than a hiding place.

He never asked about her past.  
He only asked if she wanted to be better at surviving it.

Over time, he became something like a cautious mentor — not a father figure, but the closest thing to a steady adult presence she has allowed herself to accept.
