# **Obtaining Citizenship in Marcherion**

Citizenship in [[Marcherion]] is not granted lightly. It is earned through demonstrated service, loyalty, and contribution to the city’s survival and prosperity. Since [[Marcherion]] rejects noble birthright and inherited status, every citizen must prove their worth through deeds, character, and merit.

## **Paths to Citizenship**

1. **Service in the Mercenary Guilds**
	Most citizens begin as hired soldiers, craftsmen, or support staff within one of Marcherion’s many mercenary companies or guilds. After completing at least **three years of loyal service** — including participation in multiple contracts with satisfactory conduct and reputation — a candidate may apply for citizenship. Recommendations from guild leaders or the Iron Concord increase the chances of approval.


2. **Contribution to the City’s Welfare**  
_Citizenship may also be granted to those who contribute significantly outside of military service. This can include:_


- Scholars or tacticians who improve the city’s defenses or economy.

- Merchants, artisans, or alchemists who have contributed significantly to stabilizing trade, improving fair practices, or benefiting the city’s industries and infrastructure. Candidates must demonstrate sustained, positive impact over a **minimum of five years** and receive endorsements from respected citizens or guild leaders.

- Individuals who have served in the city’s temples, assisting in religious, community, or charitable duties. These temple workers must complete at least **four years of dedicated service** and gain the endorsement of temple authorities to qualify.


3. **Early Citizenship through Participation**  
	While formal citizenship is earned individually, children of citizens often acquire it naturally by growing up immersed in the city’s life. Through education at the University of Marcherion, apprenticeships within guilds, or working alongside their parents in mercenary companies or trades, these youths gradually earn the city’s trust and privileges. This organic involvement allows many to be recognized as citizens **well before** undergoing formal trials or oaths, reflecting [[Marcherion]]’s belief that citizenship is as much about lived experience and contribution as it is about formal ceremony.


4. **The Citizen’s Trial and Oath of Allegiance**  
_To become a full citizen, applicants must undergo the **Citizen’s Trial** — a rigorous series of tests designed to measure:_


- Physical endurance and combat skill,

- Loyalty and honor under pressure,

- Wisdom and judgment through scenarios simulating the challenges of city life.

The trial culminates in the **Oath of Allegiance**, sworn before the Iron Concord and representatives of the Twelve Principles. By taking this oath, new citizens affirm:

- Their loyalty to Marcherion above all else,

- Their commitment to uphold the city’s laws and meritocratic ideals,

- Their willingness to defend the city and participate actively in its mercenary economy.

Passing the trial and swearing the oath mark the final step in proving one’s readiness to protect and advance Marcherion as a full member of its society.

### **Special Considerations**

- **Family Membership**: Citizenship is personal, not inherited. Children of citizens must earn their own status through the same process.

- **Honorary Citizenship**: The Iron Concord may grant honorary citizenship to outsiders who perform extraordinary service or bring great benefit to [[Marcherion]]. This status is rare and can be revoked if the individual fails to uphold the city’s ideals.

- **Revocation**: Citizenship can be revoked for serious breaches of law, betrayal, or dishonor. Revoked citizens lose all rights and may be expelled.

### **Summary**

Becoming a citizen of Marcherion means proving yourself worthy through service, contribution, trial, and oath. While children of citizens can earn limited privileges early by engaging with the city’s life, full citizenship is a mark of honor and responsibility earned through merit, loyalty, and strength.
