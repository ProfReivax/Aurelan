### **Description:**

Life is the sacred pulse that flows through all creation — the unseen current that gives motion to the still, breath to the silent, and purpose to the living. It is not emotion or mercy, but **vitality made divine** — the will of existence to continue against all odds.

Followers of Life revere growth in all forms: the mending of flesh, the sprouting of seed, the persistence of spirit. To nurture is to worship. To heal is to serve. Even those who extend life beyond its natural span, such as necromancers, see themselves as stewards of the great pulse, **borrowers of divine vitality**, sustaining what must not yet fade.

Temples to Life overflow with living symbols — hanging gardens, flowing water, and radiant light. Every sound and movement within them echoes the same truth: **that to live is to be part of something infinitely sacred.**

### **Tenets of the Living Pulse:**

1. **Preserve the Flame:** Every heartbeat, every leaf, every breath carries the divine spark. Guard and honor it always.
    
2. **Foster Growth:** Encourage what thrives — in soil, in body, and in spirit. Stagnation is the enemy of the living.
    
3. **Heal What Can Be Healed:** Mending wounds, soothing pain, and restoring vigor are acts of devotion.
    
4. **Uplift Creation:** Support life wherever it may bloom, and help others rise to their fullest potential.
    
5. **Embrace Vitality:** Live fully, act with purpose, and celebrate the miracle of existence in every moment.

### **Afterlife — The Verdant Heart**

> _“When the final breath fades, it joins the chorus that never ceased.”_

Followers of Life believe that when the mortal body fails, the **spark within** does not vanish — it returns to the **Verdant Heart**, the living core of all existence. There, the soul dissolves into pure vitality, becoming part of the divine rhythm that sustains every living thing.

Those who devoted themselves to preservation and growth are said to awaken as luminous forms within the Heart — their essence spreading through roots, rivers, and sunlight, feeding the next bloom of creation. To them, eternity is not rest but **renewal** — a ceaseless continuation of the act of living.

The Verdant Heart is described as a realm of radiant green light and endless motion, where thought becomes instinct and purpose becomes pulse. There, the faithful do not remember their mortal lives — they become the memory of life itself.
