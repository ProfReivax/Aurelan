_The previous period is called: [[The War of Three Crowns]]_

For the past 6 years, the lands of Auleran have known a rare calm.  
The clash of steel has quieted, armies have withdrawn from the fields, and the battle cries have faded into distant memory.

This **Fragile Peace** is a time of uneasy truce, a respite after decades of relentless war.  
Nations rebuild their shattered cities, mend the scars left on the land, and mourn the countless lives lost. Markets cautiously reopen, trade caravans once again traverse old routes, and fragile alliances begin to take shape.

Yet beneath this surface calm, old wounds still burn quietly.  
Grudges linger in the hearts of rulers and common folk alike. The weight of betrayal and loss casts a long shadow over every council chamber and tavern hearth. Suspicion simmers beneath polite words and diplomatic smiles.

[[The Empire]], vast and commanding, rules over many former foes, but its dominion is met with quiet defiance and simmering unrest.  
[[Ael'Nathra]] and [[Noctharis]], though battered and wary, remain vigilant, their leaders watching for signs of renewed aggression or secret plots.

In whispered conversations and shadowed corners, talk of spies, secret alliances, and old soldiers training in forgotten arts stirs unease.  
The ambitions that once fueled great wars have not vanished — only been tempered, waiting for the right moment to flare again.

This peace, though precious, hangs by a slender thread — a delicate balance upheld by mutual exhaustion and tentative trust.  
All across Auleran, its people hold their breath, hoping to cling to this fragile calm before the inevitable storm returns.
