It reflects Kael Marcher’s original design and the prestige of the oldest, most protected part of the city.

**Tone & Purpose:**

- Within Kael Marcher’s **first ring of walls**.
- Defensive architecture, old stone, narrow but fortified streets.
- Administrative parts of Marcherion.
- Perfect place for the **Iron Concord**, central markets, and old guildhouses.
