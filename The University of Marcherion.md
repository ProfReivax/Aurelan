### **Overview**

Founded **147 years ago**, during the city’s only real age of civic progress, the **University of Marcherion** stands just outside the ring of the [[Iron Concord]]’s spires — **close enough to power to feel its pull**, but not within its grasp. It was the last great public work funded before the Concord turned inward to serve itself.

The university’s sprawling campus mixes **military austerity with scholarly ambition**: low stone halls, training yards, and lecture terraces overlooking the city’s bustling heart. Students spar with blunted blades before attending philosophy lectures. Professors test alchemical formulas beside armored mercenaries.

It is not a place of idealism — it is a place of **utility**. Knowledge here is measured by what it can _accomplish_.


### **Reputation**

- Known across the region as the **University of Mercenaries**, a place where **tactics, trade, and applied magic** are taught side by side.

- Most scholars in other nations dismiss it as “a guild with books,” but Marcherion’s graduates are sought-after across borders — for **their pragmatism, ruthlessness, and efficiency**.

- The university’s motto, carved over its gates, reads:  
    _“Every mind sharpens a blade.”_


### **Organization & Structure**

**The Chancellor:** _Professor [[Rhael Oswin]]_, a cunning administrator and former strategist, more politician than teacher.
 
**The Three Colleges:**
- **College of War & Strategy** – Tactics, battlefield logistics, siegecraft, and command. Its students often form or lead mercenary companies.

- **College of Alchemy & Engineering** – Potion-crafting, mechanical design, and experimental arms. Their motto: _“If it works once, it’s progress.”_

 - **College of Commerce & Diplomacy** – Rhetoric, negotiation, trade law, and espionage. Many brokers, Concord agents, and guildmasters studied here.

### **Campus Life**

- Students come from all walks of life — mercenaries seeking advancement, merchants’ children, refugees, and exiles. There are **no noble houses or family crests** here — only **rank, marks, and merit**.

- Debates often end in duels, and research competitions can get dangerous.

- Instead of dormitories, many students live in **guild barracks** or **shared apartments** sponsored by patrons.

- “Graduation” is not ceremonial; it’s **earned through a contract** — completing a real commission for a client or guild, proving one’s skill in the field.

### **Notable Locations on Campus**

- **The Marcher’s Forum:** A circular courtyard where students duel, debate, and display inventions. The statue of Kael Marcher overlooks the yard from a nearby tower balcony.

- **The Inkforge:** A combined workshop and library, its forges and desks placed side by side — symbolizing the union of craft and intellect.

- **The Tower of Brass:** The Alchemy College’s most infamous lab, where failed experiments sometimes explode spectacularly. Locals treat it as a tourist attraction.

- **The Hall of Blades:** A museum-hall displaying historical weapons and artifacts, each accompanied by lessons in the strategy that made them legendary.

- [[Library of First Dawn]], annex of the university where students can study and learn for their classes
