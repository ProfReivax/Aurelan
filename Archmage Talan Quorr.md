	#People 

A stoic mage whose voice seems to echo when he speaks. His focus lies in the discipline of control — of spells, people, and politics.  

**Personality:** Logical, emotionless, and terrifyingly intelligent.  

**Goal:** Regulate all magic in Marcherion to prevent any spellcaster from rising beyond the Chorus’ reach.
