### **Basic Description:**

The god of Death is not a figure of malice or dread, but of inevitability and renewal.  
They are the silent caretaker of the cosmic balance, guiding souls through the passage between endings and beginnings. In the grand design, Death’s role is not to punish or reward, but to **recycle the essence of life itself**, ensuring that no spark of existence is ever truly lost.

Where Creation and Destruction form the twin forces of change, Death stands between them — the sculptor who shapes the remnants of what was into what may yet be.

Their followers accept mortality as sacred truth, believing that every ending feeds a new beginning. To them, **death is not to be feared, but to be respected** — the quiet breath between heartbeats, the shadow that makes light meaningful.


### **Tenets of Death

1. **Accept the Cycle:** Life and death are one motion. To cling to one is to deny the other.
2. **Honor the Passing:** Treat every ending with reverence — whether a life, a season, or a moment.
3. **Preserve Balance:** Interfere not with the flow of souls; undeath and forced prolonging of life are sacred transgressions.
4. **Bring Stillness:** Offer peace where chaos reigns, and rest where pain endures.
5. **Remember the Forgotten:** Every life, no matter how small, deserves remembrance — for even a flicker of light leaves warmth behind.


### **Verses of the Final Rest**

- **“All that lives must rest, and all that rests shall rise anew.”**  
    – Death is not an end, but a pause in the eternal rhythm.

- **“From dust to breath, from breath to dust — the song continues.”**  
    – The mortal cycle is an endless harmony of renewal.

- **“Fear not the dark; it is merely the space between stars.”**  
    – Death is a quiet interval before the next spark of being.

- **“In stillness, the soul finds its shape.”**  
    – The god molds every soul anew in the silence beyond life.

- **“The river flows unending — drink deeply, then return to its current.”**  
    – Life is borrowed from the greater stream of existence; returning it is sacred duty.



### **Afterlife: The Loom of Endings**

> _“When the final breath fades, the soul is unbound — drawn to the Loom where Death weaves its next form.”_

Followers of Death believe that upon passing, the soul journeys to the **Loom of Endings**, a vast expanse of twilight stillness where time itself slows to a whisper.  
Here, Death awaits not as a judge, but as a sculptor of souls.

Each essence is gathered and laid upon the Loom — strands of memory, emotion, and spirit are gently unraveled, then rewoven with threads of chaos drawn from Creation and Destruction alike. In this act, Death gives the soul **new form**, blending what was with infinite possibility.

Those who lived in acceptance of the Cycle feel no fear in this place. They rest, dissolve, and emerge anew — their essence renewed, their spark rebalanced. To them, the Loom is peace itself: quiet, patient, and eternal.

#### **Sayings of the Cycle**

1. **“Death is but the turning of the page — one story ending only so another may begin. Those who read without fear find that every chapter brings them closer to understanding.”**  
    – _A teaching often inscribed in temples, reminding all that endings are transitions, not losses._
