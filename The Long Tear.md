For **over a century**, the nation of **[[Ael'Nathra]]** and the kingdom of **[[Noctharis]]** were locked in a grueling and relentless war.  
The roots of their conflict ran deep — territorial disputes, ancient rivalries, clashing ideologies, and above all, a growing mutual distrust that poisoned every interaction.

As decades passed, these two great powers drew smaller, fragile neighboring nations into their struggle, each hoping to shift the balance or simply survive the storm.  
The war grew sprawling and complex, tangled in shifting alliances, protracted sieges, and fierce battles that seemed never-ending.

After a hundred years of unyielding conflict, both giants stood weary and broken in spirit.  
Their coffers were depleted, their armies exhausted, and their peoples worn down by an endless cycle of destruction and loss.  
Finally, a treaty was signed — ending the first great era of war.
