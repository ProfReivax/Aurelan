Small introduction in the daily life of the 4 player characters:

[[Henry Bubblebop]] was the first one to make an appearance as a teacher, where he had to teach/correct his young student [[Mikel]] about the use of magic in battle and how sometimes magic can be more useful than swords and bows.

We then saw him work in his research lab/office in [[The University of Marcherion]] where he was working on (...)

The next character introduced was:
[[Roxy Rabbit Killer]] hidden in the wardrobe of the house of a [[The Black Chalice]] executive where she found information of a new drug being brought to town soon and something about a loan from [[The Gilded Ledger]] to maximize the amount of this product they can get in the city of [[Marcherion]]

We then saw her meet up with her mentor [[Serevin “Greyquill” Marrow]] and making her report from [[the iron ravens]] at [[the black roost]].

She then went out at [[The Silver Seat Tavern]] where she played her flute and met [[Hitbarks Hiltgrown]] and had a nice evening with them, before returning home in their small apartment outside the city walls.

The next character introduced was:
[[Garran Thale]] was patrolling on his early shift as a guard part of [[The Iron Fangs]]. On his shift he defused an altercation between [[Brenna Holt]] and [[Carrane Hilda]] about the prices at [[Holt’s Groceries]]. 

after his shift he went to his local bar (enter bar here) where he had dinner with his roommate [[Lyrin Vael]] and learned about a contract that was going to be published soon about a missing caravan.

the next character introduced was:
[[Farideh Daardendrian]] was at [[Herbal Remedies]] speaking with [[Lysa Greenthorn]] when she heard about the altercation at [[Holt’s Groceries]] and went to investigate. she learned about the altercation and discussed plans of creating a [[Marcherion]] integration course with [[Brenna Holt]] who wasn't much interested. [[Farideh Daardendrian]] then bought 2 [[citrange]]s.

She then went to the [[Library of First Dawn]] where after talking with [[Serenya Daskelle]], learned of the passage of [[High Seeker Malen Tareth]] at [[The University of Marcherion]]. She wanted to investigate his presence at the university but then opted for making dinner instead, a salad with her citranges. While eating she heard [[Maraleen]] and [[High Seeker Malen Tareth]] speaking of the missing caravan and then asked if she could take the contract to help with the missing documents from the caravan.

On the next day, all the PCs met and went to a bar (whats this bar?) and are trying to learn more about each other over drinks before heading out tomorrow morning.

the crew also rented some draft horses and a wagon for their quest.
