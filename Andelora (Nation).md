#Nation 

Bordered only to the north-west by [[The Empire]], the rest being surrounded by the ocean.

Arid hills streaked with veins of white and golden marble encircle the west of the nation. Though not tall enough to hinder passage, they rise just high enough to mark the transition into a distinct and vibrant land. Small green valleys nestle between them, home to spice plantations and marble-cutting villages called [[The Marblers]], where the day’s heat mingles with the salt-scented breeze from the sea.

The climate is warm and humid, defined by two dominant seasons: the **rainy season**, when the sky unleashes torrents that nourish the eastern coastal jungles, and the **dry season**, when the sun reigns supreme, making the marble hills shimmer like frozen waves. In the lower plains, vegetation thrives — palm trees, tropical figs, giant orchids, and flowering vines flourish along the rivers.

The fauna is just as vivid: iridescent birds, sunbathing reptiles, and the elusive marble cats of the hills, whose speckled coats blend with the stone’s shadows. The air carries the perfume of hibiscus and salt, and at dusk, the horizon burns with molten gold and violet light.

To the southeast, the nation’s borders dissolve into the ocean. There lies **[[Andelora, the Pearl of the Depth]]**, a partially submerged capital — a masterpiece of coral architecture and ancient magic. Built between land and sea, it stands as a symbol of the nation’s delicate balance between the fiery vitality of the surface and the tranquil mystery of the deep.
