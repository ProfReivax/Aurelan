## Location & Owner
Location: **[[The Concord Market]]**
_Owner:_ **[[Dren Korrin]]**

## Short Description
_Shop:_ Specializes in durable medium and heavy armor, with custom fittings for mercenary companies. 

## Long Description
A sturdy stone-fronted shop marked by the hiss of the forge and the smell of oiled steel. Ironhide Armory deals mainly in **durable medium and heavy armor**, built for practical use rather than show. The interior is clean, organized, and lined with reinforced racks holding chain, scale, and half-plate.

A small wall displays a collection of battered helmets — each from a mercenary who “forgot to duck,” according to the owner.
