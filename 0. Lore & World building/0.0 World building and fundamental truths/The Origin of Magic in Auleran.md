# **The Origin of Magic in Auleran**

### _Creation and Destruction, The First Couple_

Before anything else existed—  
before gods, dragons, planes, or stars—  
there were two beings woven from the same spark:

**[[Creation]]**  
and  
**[[Destruction]]**.

They were not opposites.  
They were partners.  
A balance, a cycle, a single heartbeat beating in two halves.

Creation shaped potential.  
Destruction shaped meaning.  
Together, they brought harmony to the emptiness—  
a dance of making and unmaking that defined the first age.

In their love, they desired children who could inherit their wonders.

# **Their Children: The Six Primordial Dragons**

Creation and Destruction conceived six magnificent beings—  
the **Primordial Dragons**, each embodying an essence of the new world.

- **[[Ignivar]]** – Fire
- **[[Delphire]]** – Water
- **[[Gaiora]]** – Earth
- **[[Zephyra]]** – Wind
- **[[Luminal]]** – Light
- **[[Umbriar]]** – Darkness

To these children, **Creation** offered a gift:
### **[[Magic]]**

Not a weapon, but a legacy—  
the ability to shape the world through will, pattern, and desire.

Every thought of a dragon, every breath, every beat of their wings  
left ripples of magic in the forming world.

To balance Creation’s gift, **Destruction** offered their own:

### **[[Void]]**

Not erasure, but control—  
cooling the fire, quieting the wind, calming wild magic when needed.

Void was not a punishment.  
Void was guidance.  
A way to keep their children safe from their own vast power.

Creation and Destruction gave equally,  
as partners,  
as parents.

# **The Betrayal of the Gods**

When the younger gods emerged, shaped unintentionally from the overflow of Creation and Destruction’s power,  
they looked upon the primordial dragons with bitter awe.  
For the dragons had been _wanted_—  
born of intention, shaped with care,  
and cherished by the First Dragons with a devotion the younger gods would never know.

The gods were not made through design or desire.  
They were consequences, echoes, afterthoughts of a love they could never claim.

And so jealousy took root.

Some hungered to prove themselves worthy.  
Some sought to erase the reminder that they were never the first children.  
Others simply wished to stand where the primordial dragons stood.

Whatever their reasons, they moved together toward a single, terrible resolve.

In a conflict veiled by myth and buried by their own decrees,  
**the gods struck down the primordial dragons.**

The world convulsed beneath the weight of the deed.  
And across all creation,  
the cries of the First Dragons echoed—  
not in wrath, but in grief beyond measure.

# **The Shattering of Gifts**

As each dragon died:

## **Magic burst outward**

—Creation’s gift, no longer contained in living vessels—  
and spread across the world in a radiant explosion.

The dragons’ essence, their breath and will and soul-patterns,  
wove themselves into the fabric of existence.

This is how **the Weave** was born:  
a tapestry made from the shattered echoes of the dragons.

Creation, overwhelmed with grief, whispered:

**“Let them remain.  
Let the world remember them.”**

And Creation allowed the Weave to spread freely,  
untamed and eternal.

## **Void returned to Destruction.**

Destruction felt a grief beyond words—  
not because of ruin,  
but because of loss.

Destruction pulled back their gift,  
withdrawing **Void** into themselves  
as a final memory of their children.

What remains of Void in the world are the scars of Destruction’s sorrow—  
rare places where the Weave cannot reach.

Void is not evil.  
Void is grief, memory, boundary, and the shadow of love.

# **The Weave of Auleran**

## **_The Inner Workings of Magic_**

All magic in Auleran flows from a single source: the Weave.  
It is a vast, invisible lattice — a shimmering network of countless threads stretched through every atom of stone, every breath of wind, every beat of every living heart.

The Weave is the _pattern_ beneath reality’s surface, the hidden dance of possibility and change that binds the world together.  
No eye can see it directly, no hand can hold it — yet every spark of magic is the Weave made visible, every spell a momentary ripple in its infinite strands.

To perceive the Weave is to glimpse the true nature of existence:  
that all things, from the smallest grain of sand to the grandest mountain, share an intricate web of connection, vibration, and flow.

## **_Touching the Threads_**

Though the Weave is one, its threads are many — and mortals come to them in countless ways, each touching a different strand, each bending the pattern in their own unique way.

Some approach the Weave as a scholar might approach a grand tome, reading its structure and tracing its logic with care and precision.

Others feel it in the music of a song, the rhythm of a dance, or the color of a painted vision.

Some are born woven into the Weave itself, their very souls echoing its hidden pulses.

Others hear the breath of the natural world, the living patterns pulsing beneath every leaf and stone.

Still others rely not on their own grasp, but on the will of powers beyond mortal ken, who grant them glimpses of the Weave’s power as gifts or debts.

## _**The Philosophy of Magic in Auleran_**
Though the Weave is universal, each tradition explains it differently:

- **Wizards** call it _structure_.
- **Bards** call it _song_.
- **Druids** call it _life_.
- **Clerics** call it _the divine link_.
- **Sorcerers** call it _instinct_.
- **Warlocks** call it _an exchange.
- **Paladins** call it _faith made manifest_.

All are correct.  
None are complete.  
The Weave is vast enough to hold every truth.
