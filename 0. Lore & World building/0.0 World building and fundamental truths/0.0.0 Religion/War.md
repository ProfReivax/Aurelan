### **Description:**

War is the relentless force of conflict and change — neither good nor evil, but a crucible where strength, strategy, and will are tested and forged. It is the clash that shapes civilizations, the storm that sweeps away stagnation, and the harsh teacher that demands sacrifice and resolve.

Followers of War accept conflict as an inevitable part of existence, recognizing it as a force that reveals both the noblest and darkest aspects of beings. War is neither mindless bloodshed nor blind valor; it is a balance of destruction and discipline, chaos and order, passion and strategy.

Temples dedicated to War stand as fortresses and halls of strategy, adorned with weapons, banners, and the echoes of past battles. Warriors, tacticians, and veterans serve the god, seeking strength, courage, and clarity amid the tumult of conflict.

### **Afterlife — The Eternal Vanguard**

> _“Those who fall in battle rise to stand forever on the front lines of eternity.”_

Followers of War believe that souls of the fallen are gathered into the **Eternal Vanguard** — a boundless realm of endless battlefields bathed in twilight, where warriors continue their eternal fight, honing their skills and honor.

The Vanguard is not a place of torment, but of preparation and valor. Here, spirits train, spar, and march in unending formations, forever sharpening their resolve for wars beyond mortal understanding.

Only those who have embraced the discipline and sacrifice of war earn the right to stand in the Vanguard; others may find their spirits wandering the silent plains of forgotten battles.
