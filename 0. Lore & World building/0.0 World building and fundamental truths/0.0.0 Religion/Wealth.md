## **Basic Description:**

The god of Wealth governs prosperity, abundance, and the flow of resources that sustain life and power. Neither a mere giver nor hoarder of riches, this deity embodies the balance between gain and loss, generosity and greed. To some followers, the god is a benevolent patron of fortune and growth; to others, a stern judge of how wealth is earned and spent.

## **Afterlife**

### 📜 **The Everflowing Treasury — A Belief of the Faithful**

> _“When the final coin falls, the soul enters the Everflowing Treasury.”_

The faithful believe that after death, souls enter the **Everflowing Treasury**, a vast, shimmering vault beyond mortal realms where the essence of wealth—material and spiritual—is gathered and renewed.

This realm is a grand treasury filled with endless chambers of gold, gems, and artifacts, but also libraries, gardens, and workshops symbolizing knowledge and creativity. Here, souls are judged not by what they hoarded, but by how they used their wealth to build, support, and enrich others.

The Everflowing Treasury is ever-shifting—its halls extend as long as generosity flows and contract where greed stalls. Souls who embraced balance and generosity find themselves at peace, contributing to the treasury’s eternal abundance. Those who clung selfishly to riches face endless echoes of scarcity until they learn to let go.

In this place, wealth is not static treasure but a living force, a cycle of giving and receiving that echoes through eternity.
