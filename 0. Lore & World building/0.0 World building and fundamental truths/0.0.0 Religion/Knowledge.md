**Basic Description:**  
The god of knowledge embodies both the pursuit of wisdom and the responsibility that comes with it. For the clerics who follow the enlightened path, the focus is on sharing knowledge, fostering wisdom, and illuminating the world with truth.


**Tenets of the Enlightened Path:**

1. **Pursue Wisdom:** Always seek to learn and grow, for knowledge is a never-ending journey.

2. **Collaborate in Discovery:** Every mind holds a fragment of truth; only together can the full picture emerge.

3. **Guide with Understanding:** Let knowledge shape your actions and influence those around you with clarity and purpose.

4. **Respect the Power of Knowing:** Knowledge shapes the world — wield it with awareness, not impulse.

5. **Preserve Understanding:** Knowledge, once lost, dims the world; protect it, though not all truths must be shown.

 ***AFTERLIFE***
 📜 **The Luminous Archive — As Taught by the Enlightened Scribes**

> _“When the final breath leaves the seeker, the mind awakens.”_  
> So it is written in the Scrolls of Continuance, that death is not an ending, but a revelation. The faithful believe that beyond the mortal veil lies the **Luminous Archive**, the eternal library of the god of knowledge, where thought itself takes form.

Those who have lived in honest pursuit of wisdom — who sought truth not for power but for understanding — are welcomed when their mortal shell fades.  
They awaken in a vast expanse of light and parchment, a realm made not of stone or air but of **ideas woven into being**. The sky there is written in shifting words; the rivers are memory flowing clear and eternal.

Every soul is said to arrive carrying the weight of what they have learned. Their thoughts become pages in an infinite tome, and their experiences ink that glows softly with divine light. To enter the Archive is to _become both student and scripture._

The Luminous Archive is not bound by place. Some say it takes the form of an endless library of crystal shelves; others claim it appears as tranquil gardens where each leaf whispers a lesson. Each soul perceives it as it must — for the Archive mirrors the mind that beholds it.

Within its halls, the faithful are free to explore, to question, to debate with the spirits of ages past. There is no hunger, no pain, only the boundless joy of discovery and the serenity of understanding. Every revelation there deepens one’s communion with the divine, until the soul itself becomes part of the god’s endless thought — a spark within the greater illumination.
