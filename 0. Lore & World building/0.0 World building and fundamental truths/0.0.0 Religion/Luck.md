## **Basic Description:**

Neither wholly benevolent nor cruel, this deity embodies the chaotic balance between fortune’s gifts and misfortunes. To some followers, the god is a bringer of opportunity and hope; to others, a reminder that fate can be capricious and merciless.

## Afterlife
### 📜 **The Endless Game — A Belief of the Faithful**

> _“When life’s final hand is played, the soul steps beyond the veil into the Great Gamble.”_

The faithful teach that the afterlife is not a place of rest, but a grand cosmic game — a realm of ever-shifting fortunes and endless possibility known as the **Endless Game**. Here, souls are neither rewarded nor punished in the usual sense; instead, they become players in an eternal dance of chance and choice.

The landscape of the Endless Game is a vast, shifting board with pieces that change form and rules that evolve with every turn. Rolling dice echo like thunder across a starry sky, and the flicker of cards heralds new fates spun from the threads of probability.

In this realm, every soul wagers their essence against the unknown, learning that luck is not merely fortune’s whim but the heart of existence itself — unpredictable, thrilling, and inescapable. Success here depends on cunning, adaptability, and the willingness to embrace uncertainty.

Some souls find great joy in this eternal challenge, honing their fate like master players. Others struggle with the endless twists, but all are bound by the same cosmic game that shapes worlds and weaves destinies.
