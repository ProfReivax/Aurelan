Leader of: **[[The Ember Pact]]**

An arcanist with burn-scarred hands and a mind like wildfire. Once expelled from the Obsidian Chorus for “reckless experimentation.”  

**Personality:** Brilliant, impulsive, and theatrical — a true pyromancer’s soul.  

**Goal:** Prove the destructive arts are the future of warfare, and that chaos can be profitably controlled.
