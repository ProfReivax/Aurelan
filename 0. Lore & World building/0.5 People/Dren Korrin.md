**Male dwarf, 88.**  
A former quartermaster of [[The Iron Fangs]], Dren is **gruff, straightforward, and allergic to haggling**. He speaks plainly, works efficiently, and expects customers to know what they’re looking for. Despite his rough manner, he has a reputation for fairness and excellent craftsmanship.

Dren personally handles fittings and repairs, and he refuses to sell anything he considers unfit for real combat.
