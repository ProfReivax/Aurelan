**Title:** Chancellor of [[The University of Marcherion]]

**Description:** A scholarly man in his early fifties with streaks of silver in his dark hair and sharp, observant eyes behind thin spectacles. Always impeccably dressed in robes blending traditional academic colors with practical leatherwork suited to the city’s mercenary spirit.

**Personality:** Methodical and pragmatic, Rhael balances intellectual curiosity with a keen sense of political survival. He values knowledge as a tool — both for personal advancement and the city’s resilience — but remains wary of the Iron Concord’s interference.

**Role:** As Chancellor, Rhael oversees the university’s diverse disciplines, from battlefield tactics and alchemy to diplomacy and arcane research. He strives to maintain the institution’s independence and uphold the vision of Marcherion’s founding marshal, even as the city around him grows more volatile.
