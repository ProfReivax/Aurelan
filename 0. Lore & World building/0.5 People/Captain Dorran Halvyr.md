Leader of: **[[The Crimson Wolves]]**

Once a soldier in a doomed border war, now a hardened commander of free blades. His band treats warfare as an art of survival, not glory.  

**Personality:** Blunt, grizzled, loyal only to those who pay and bleed beside him.  

**Goal:** Secure permanent control over the outer territories that feed Marcherion’s mercenary economy.
