Leader of: **[[The Iron Scribes]]**

An elderly, ink-stained bureaucrat whose mastery of law and magical contracts makes him effectively untouchable.  

**Personality:** Soft-spoken, pedantic, obsessed with detail — but dangerous when underestimated.  

**Goal:** Keep every Concord member bound in legal webbing so tight that rebellion becomes bureaucratically impossible.
