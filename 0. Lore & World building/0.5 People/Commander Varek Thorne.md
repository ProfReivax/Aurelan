The Current City Marshal of [[Marcherion]]

Leader of: **[[The Iron Fangs]]**
A towering, scarred veteran who rose from the rank and file during the city’s last major riot. Known for his strict discipline and his belief that “fear is order.”  

**Personality:** Cold, pragmatic, and utterly loyal to the structure of power — not the people who hold it.  

**Goal:** Maintain the Iron Fangs’ monopoly on the city guard and ensure no rival company gains legal authority.


**Why Chosen:**  
In the uneasy years following the War, when mercenaries flooded home and the streets brimmed with unrest, the Iron Concord needed a soldier, not a diplomat. Varek Thorne — the “Iron Hound” — was their answer. His reputation for crushing insurrections and restoring brutal order made him the perfect symbol of post-war stability. The vote passed swiftly, with only the Twelve Pillars and the Gilded Ledger opposing his rise, fearing a return to military rule.

**Rule and Methods:**

- Rebuilt the city guard into a disciplined, quasi-military force.
    
- Declared martial oversight in the Outer Wards “until peace endures.”
    
- Works closely with the Iron Scribes and Veiled Blades to silence unrest through law and fear alike.
    

**Public Image:**  
To the weary citizens of Marcherion, he’s the man who ended chaos — a savior of stone and steel. To those who remember freedom, he’s the war that never ended. The Concord sees him as a loyal weapon… though some whisper he’s begun to think like a ruler, not a soldier.
