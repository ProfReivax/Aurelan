Leader of: **[[The Gilded Ledger]]**

A plump, soft-spoken man who never leaves his marble tower — said to have personally financed five coups and three wars without lifting a sword.  

**Personality:** Polite, eerily unflappable, and always two steps ahead in debt and credit.  

**Goal:** Bind every guild and company to the Ledger through debt; financial control as the purest form of dominance.
