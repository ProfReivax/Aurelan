Leader of: **[[The Blackened Anvils]]**

A dwarven matriarch who runs the forges like a temple, every strike of the hammer a prayer. Her smiths are fanatically loyal.  

**Personality:** Proud, traditional, and humorless — believes industry is the truest faith.  

**Goal:** Expand her guild’s monopoly to include shipyards and war machines — “if it can be forged, it belongs to us.”
