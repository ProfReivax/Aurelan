#People 

Leader of: **[[The Twelve Pillars]]**

A serene priest of the god of [[Knowledge]], famed for his calm demeanor and piercing insight. Believes truth must temper power. 

**Personality:** Gentle but firm, with a quiet intensity that unsettles his peers.  

**Goal:** Restore faith as a moral compass within the city — even as he quietly gathers a following large enough to challenge the Concord’s dominance.


Very knowledgeable figure surrounding the [[Pantheon of Auleran]] in general since they need to represent all religion on the [[Iron Concord]]
