## Description
A serene priest of the god of [[Knowledge]], Malen is known for his calm demeanor and piercing insight. He believes that truth must temper power and approaches his duties with gentle firmness and quiet intensity—sometimes unsettling his peers.

Though closely involved with the broader [[Pantheon of Auleran]] and serving as a key figure in the [[Iron Concord]] and **[[The Twelve Pillars]]**, his obligations often pull him away from the Library of First Dawn. Malen’s primary goal is to restore faith as a moral compass within the city, while quietly gathering a following strong enough to challenge the Concord’s dominance.

Though rarely present, his influence in the city’s religious and political spheres is profound, and his name commands respect among scholars and clergy alike.

he appointed [[Maraleen]] as the Archivist-Primus of the [[Library of First Dawn]] since he didn't have the time to fulfill that role himself
