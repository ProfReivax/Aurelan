Officer of a part of the guards of [[Marcherion]].

Rathos sees [[Farideh Daardendrian]] as a walking truth detector and uses her:

- to read testimony
- help decode evidence
- assess magical artifacts

He trusts her more than most mages because she’s bluntly honest.
He is also a very useful ally if she ever gets in trouble.

Member of [[The Iron Fangs]]
