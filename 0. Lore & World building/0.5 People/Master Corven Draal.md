**Leader of:** _[[The Iron Ravens]]_

A lean, sharp-eyed man dressed in plain charcoal attire, always composed and unreadable. Corven moves with deliberate precision, and his calm voice carries the weight of someone who listens far more than he speaks.

### **Personality**

Quiet, calculating, and unflinchingly controlled. Corven values secrets more than gold, viewing information as the only true currency with lasting worth.  
He speaks sparingly—only when his words can steer outcomes or shift the balance of a situation.

Though outwardly neutral, there is an undeniable intensity behind his eyes, as if he is always evaluating every angle, every motive, every lie left unspoken.

Rumors swirl around him: some claim he has forged **pacts with Memory spirits**, granting him perfect recall; others believe his mind has been shaped by relentless training or subtle arcane enhancement. Whatever the truth, Corven’s reputation for remembering _everything_ he has ever heard is widely feared.

### **Goal**

To position the Iron Ravens as the **unseen power** of [[Marcherion]].  
Corven intends for every secret, message, whisper, and rumor to pass through his network first—allowing the guild to quietly shape the city’s destiny from the shadows.

He does not seek open rule or political titles.  
**He seeks control of the city’s narrative.**

By deciding what information flows—and what is buried—Corven believes he can maintain stability, prevent chaos, and ensure Marcherion’s future rests in capable, calculating hands.
