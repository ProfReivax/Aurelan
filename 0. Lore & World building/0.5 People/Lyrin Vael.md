# **Appearance**

A wiry, sharp-featured woman with wind-tangled black hair and a sun-bleached cloak still faintly smelling of brine. Her skin has the toughened look of someone who grew up on boats and marched through too many battlefields.  
Her uniform of the Iron Scribes is always a little rumpled, ink stains creeping onto the cuffs, and she wears a small seashell on a cord around her wrist — a token from home.

Her voice is low and raspy, as if permanently hoarse from shouting commands over ocean winds and battlefield chaos.

# **Personality**

**Tone:** Dry wit, calm under pressure  
**Attitude:** Pragmatic, protective, quietly affectionate toward Garran  
**Habits:**

- Always has at least three quills tucked behind her ear
    
- “Reads” people the way other soldiers read terrain
    
- Hums old coastal work-songs when thinking  
    **Quirk:** Bargains in nautical metaphors (“That’s a bad tide to sail into, friend.”)
    

Despite her administrative job, she still moves like a soldier: steady stance, eyes always tracking exits, hand instinctively rising toward where her spear _used_ to hang.

# **Shared History with Garran**

Lyrin served in the same unit during the Empire’s coastal campaigns. Before the war, she worked on her family’s fishing boat — _the same waters Garran’s parents still sail_.

There was a time they would pull night watch together, perched on ruined ramparts overlooking a burning horizon, trading whispered stories about home to keep the dark at bay.  
Garran earned the nickname _Windpipes_ when he first sang during a march; Lyrin was the one who joked that his voice “carried clearer than a lighthouse horn.”

They’ve saved each other more times than either will admit.

# **Role in Garran’s Present Life**

### **1. Shared Home**

They split rent in an apartment that’s half-military barracks, half-document archive. Garran handles repairs; Lyrin handles organization.  
She also leaves him notes in the margins of his food pantry items (“Buy more tea, you storm-headed forgetful sod.”)

### **2. Access to Contracts**

Lyrin handles the **pre-screening** of documents within the Iron Scribes.  
She sometimes “accidentally” leaves drafts on the kitchen table, giving Garran early access to contracts before they hit the public board.  
She never says she’s doing him a favor — she just raises an eyebrow and asks if he’s “feeling up for a bit of coin today.”

### **3. Emotional Anchor**

Lyrin is one of the only people who knew Arel, Serana, and Dorn personally.  
She shares the same ghosts.  
On the anniversary of Dorn’s death, she insists on cooking a salty stew the way their unit used to, then sits with Garran in silence as he sings.

# **Motivation & Inner Conflict**

Lyrin hides guilt behind paperwork and sarcasm.  
She was the one running logistics when the unit walked into the ambush that killed Serana. She has never forgiven herself for “reading that map wrong.”  
Her work with the Scribes is her way of ensuring others won’t suffer from bad information or broken agreements.

She believes keeping Garran alive and grounded is the last duty she owes her fallen comrades.

# **Combat Role (if she joins the party occasionally)**

**Class Template:** Fighter (Tactician) / Rogue (Scout)  
**Style:**

- Prefer fighting defensively
    
- Uses short spear and buckler
    
- Calls out warnings and openings
    
- Can bolster allies by predicting enemy movements  
    **Signature Move:** _Tidebreak Step_ — a sudden pivot and shield check that opens space for allies.
    

Lyrin is no longer a frontline warrior, but in emergencies?  
The old instincts snap back like a drawn bow.

# **Relationship with Garran (Tone for RP)**

Not romantic — but profound.  
They speak in half-sentences and shared looks.  
They’ve weathered war, loss, and rebirth together.

When Garran falters, Lyrin straightens him.  
When Lyrin spirals into guilt, Garran grounds her with the simple rhythm of march-beats and song.

They don’t need flowery words — only trust.
