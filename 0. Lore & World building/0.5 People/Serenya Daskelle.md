A determined **halfling woman in her early 40s**, Serenya carries herself with remarkable confidence and calm authority that far outweighs her small stature. Her curly chestnut hair frames a face marked by sharp green eyes that gleam with wisdom and resolve. Clad in gleaming, rune-etched armor specially crafted to fit her, she moves with practiced grace and undeniable strength.

Her presence commands respect—not just for her martial prowess, but for her unwavering dedication to preserving [[knowledge]] and life.

Serenya’s history is deeply entwined with the Library and with [[Farideh Daardendrian]]. Ten years ago, during the brutal [[The War of Three Crowns]], she led a daring rescue mission, saving the then-14-year-old Farideh from the flames and ruin. Since that day, Serenya has acted as both guardian and mentor, guiding Farideh’s growth not only as a cleric but as a person carrying the weight of survival and purpose.

Though her duties often take her away from the quiet stacks of books to patrol the city and protect sacred archives from threats both mundane and magical, she remains a constant pillar within the Library’s walls. Known for her sharp mind as much as her sword arm, Serenya frequently advises the Archivist-Primus [[Maraleen]] and stands as an intermediary between scholars and the city’s defenders.

Her relationship with Farideh is layered: protector, big sister, occasional disciplinarian, and a symbol of hope from a dark past. Together, they represent the living legacy of the [[Library of First Dawn]]’s mission to safeguard knowledge and nurture those who seek it.
