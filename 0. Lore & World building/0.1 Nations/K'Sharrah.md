#Nation 

K’Sharrah is a vast, sun-washed savannah stretching across the Empire’s northern frontier. Golden grasses roll for miles beneath open skies, broken only by scattered stone outcrops and ancient migration paths carved by great herds. The climate is warm, dry, and windy, with dramatic storms during the short wet season.

The region is home to one of the largest populations of **Thérionides** in [[The Empire]], many of whom trace their ancestral lineages to the plains themselves. Their traditions deeply influence local culture—open-air markets, communal gathering circles, wide-spaced settlements, and a strong emphasis on personal honor and skilled craftsmanship.

Though it is officially a province of the Empire, K’Sharrah maintains a distinct identity. Imperial rule is present but lighter than elsewhere; local councils, caravan leaders, and clan-based communities hold as much influence as appointed governors. For most Imperial citizens, K’Sharrah is a place of hardy people, endless horizons, dangerous wildlife, and unmatched leatherwork, metalcraft, and mounted scouting.

### The Three Tribes of K’Sharrah

1. **The Veshari**  
    _Known as the “Windrunners”_  
    The Veshari live in the open plains and are famed for their exceptional speed and agility. They are expert hunters and trackers who prize swift, precise movements in both hunting and combat. Their culture emphasizes freedom and the spirit of the chase. Veshari tattoos often depict flowing lines and wind motifs.

2. **The Dran’Khal**  
    _Known as the “Stoneclaws”_  
    The Dran’Khal inhabit the rocky outcrops and foothills bordering the savannah. They are hardy and resilient, with a reputation for unyielding strength and fierce defense of their territory. They are often the protectors of K’Sharrah, skilled in close combat and guerrilla tactics. Their tattoos are bold geometric shapes, resembling the jagged stones they call home.

3. **The Saeluri**  
    _Known as the “Suncallers”_  
    The Saeluri are the spiritual custodians, living near the ancient baobab groves and sacred pools. They are keepers of lore, healers, and Sunwatchers, tasked with maintaining the balance between people and the land. Saeluri customs focus on meditation, ritual, and the art of storytelling. Their tattoos incorporate sunbursts, circles, and intricate patterns symbolizing cycles of life.


#### Key Customs:

- **The Hunt of the New Day**  
    Every year at the start of the dry season, tribes gather before dawn to perform the Hunt of the New Day — a communal hunt symbolizing the renewal of life and survival. Young hunters are tested, elders share stories, and the catch is shared equally, emphasizing cooperation and respect for nature’s balance.

- **The Great Gathering**  
	Once every three years, all the tribes of K’Sharrah come together for the Great Gathering, a week-long festival of dance, storytelling, and competitions in skill, strength, and wisdom. It’s a time to renew alliances, resolve disputes, and celebrate shared heritage.
