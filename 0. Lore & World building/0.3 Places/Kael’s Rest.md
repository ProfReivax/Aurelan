#Place

## **Layout:**

- Rows of modest wooden stalls, some permanent, many semi-permanent tents, arranged in winding paths around the lake([[Stillwater Basin]]).
- Shops are medium to small-sized, with colorful awnings and hand-painted signs.
- Open-air communal tables and fire pits for socializing in the evenings.        

## **Merchants and Goods:**

- Everyday items like textiles, pottery, simple clothing, cooking utensils, basic tools, and personal hygiene products.
- Artisans selling handcrafted jewelry, leather goods, and carved wooden toys.
- Herbalists and apothecaries with remedies and simple tonics.
- Fishermen and fishmongers selling fresh catch straight from Mirror’s Haven.
- Small stalls offering street food and fresh-baked bread, but nothing extravagant or heavily spiced (food vendors mostly stay at Kael’s Rest’s neighboring taverns).        

## **Atmosphere:**

- Friendly and familiar, with vendors calling out deals and locals chatting comfortably.
- Children play near the lake while their parents shop or sit nearby.
- Occasional street musicians and performers add liveliness without overwhelming noise.
- Tension is lower than in the main market, but wary eyes are still present — the city’s mercenary nature lingers.
