**Guildhall of:** [[The Iron Ravens]]
**Location:** At the heart of [[Marcherion]], beside [[The Concord Market]] and built right in front of [[The Iron Spires]].

## **General Appearance**

### **Exterior**

The Black Roost is a tall, narrow building of dark stone and iron, blending naturally with the surrounding Spires. Despite its central location, it feels strangely subdued.

Key visuals:

- Dark metal framework with riveted beams

- A single iron raven emblem above a reinforced wooden door

- Tall, thin windows of blackened glass

- A slanted roof that rises into a small lookout perch

It looks like an unassuming courier office — but something about its stiffness and shadowed windows gives most people pause.

### **Interior**

Inside, the guildhall is quiet, ordered, and slightly oppressive.

General visual features:

- Smooth slate floors that echo softly

- Narrow hallways lit by dim, steady lanterns

- Walls lined with message slots, sealed tubes, and simple shelves

- Dark wooden counters polished by constant use

- Iron railings and staircases with clean, angular lines

The decor is minimal: no banners, no bright colors, just functional materials in shades of grey, black, and dull metal.

### **Atmosphere**

Though always busy, the building feels hushed. Conversations drop to whispers, and footsteps seem louder than they should. Visitors often describe the sensation of being _watched_, though they can never say by whom.

### **Overall Impression**

A stark, disciplined structure that mirrors [[The Iron Ravens]] themselves — quiet, precise, and vigilant. The Black Roost stands as a fixed shadow in the heart of Marcherion, outwardly mundane but undeniably unsettling.
