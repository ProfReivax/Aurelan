### Description
The Temple of [[Justice]], annexed to [[Marcherion]]’s High Courthouse, is a place where the sacred ideals of fairness and balance merge seamlessly with the city’s legal authority. It is not a temple for worship in the traditional sense but a solemn space dedicated to the living practice of justice—where law is both honored and sanctified.

The building’s architecture is marked by clean lines, sturdy stonework, and minimal ornamentation, reflecting the impartiality and clarity the god of Justice demands. Tall, narrow windows admit steady shafts of pale light that illuminate the polished floors and walls etched with geometric symbols of balance and truth. The atmosphere is cool, hushed, and serious—inviting reflection, solemnity, and respect from all who enter.

Visitors to the temple—whether magistrates, litigants, or citizens—are met with an environment that encourages measured thought and careful speech. The sense of order here is tangible, reinforced by the quiet dignity of the space and the steady presence of those who serve within it.

Though austere, the temple holds a profound weight: it embodies the principle that justice is not swayed by status, wealth, or passion. It is a place where truth is sought, fairness is upheld, and consequences are meted with unwavering clarity. The Temple of Justice stands as a living testament to the ideal that law and morality are intertwined pillars holding the city—and society itself—together.
