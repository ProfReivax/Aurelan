#Organisation 

**Leader:** _[[Master Corven Draal]]_  
**Guildhall**: _[[The Black Roost]]_
**Type:** Courier, Espionage, and Intelligence Guild  
**Specialty:** Secure message delivery, covert surveillance, information brokerage  
**Influence:** The city’s unseen eyes and ears, shaping what is known—and what stays hidden.

### **Overview**

The Iron Ravens are [[Marcherion]]’s most discreet and unsettling guild—an organization that thrives in the liminal space between legitimate courier work and outright espionage. Their insignia, a stylized raven wrought in blackened iron, is recognized across the city as the mark of a messenger you can trust absolutely… or fear completely.

Their stated mission is to **ensure the safe and timely delivery of information**, but everyone in Marcherion understands the truth:  
**If knowledge is the lifeblood of the city, the Iron Ravens are the ones who decide how fast it flows—and in which direction.**

### **Structure & Operations**

- **Messengers (“Wings”)**  
    Highly trained couriers known for endurance, stealth, and near-fanatical loyalty. Each “Wing” wears a thin cloak with feather-patterned stitching and carries hidden compartments for encoded messages.

- **Shadowwatchers**  
    The guild’s internal surveillance agents. They keep tabs on high-profile citizens, suspicious travelers, and sometimes even other guilds. Few know their identities—some might not even be official members.

- **Whisper-Scribes**  
    Specialists in ciphers, codes, and magical communication. They maintain the guild’s archive of intercepted messages and recovered secrets. They are feared for their quiet, emotionless demeanor.

- **Black Flights**  
    The elite strike teams deployed only on high-stakes missions: retrieving stolen documents, tailing dangerous individuals, or sabotaging rival information networks. Their existence is officially denied.


### **Reputation in Marcherion**

- Most citizens view them with **a mix of gratitude and unease**.
- Merchants trust Iron Raven couriers more than city guards.
- Politicians hate them but can’t afford to ignore them.
- Other guilds respect them… and dread their attention.

The common saying goes:  
**“If a Raven knows your secret, pray they’re paid to keep it.”**

### **Internal Philosophy**

The guild’s guiding principle is **“Information is power; power must be managed.”**  
They see themselves as **curators**, not manipulators—though many outside the guild disagree.

To them:

- _A secret revealed too early is as dangerous as a sword drawn too quickly._

- _A lie ignored is a poison._

- _Truth is a tool, not a virtue._


### **Notable Customs**

- **The Black Oath**: Initiates swear a lifelong vow of silence regarding guild affairs. Breaking it is considered worse than treason.

- **The Feather Rite**: A member’s cloak is stripped of its “feathers” upon disgrace, symbolizing exile from the flock.

- **The Night Roost**: Once per month, all high-ranking members meet at an undisclosed location to share intelligence and decide what truths to release into the city’s rumor-stream.
