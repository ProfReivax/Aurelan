_The previous period is called: [[The Long Tear]]_

While the lands sought to heal their wounds, a modest power — once little known under another name — rose from the ashes of the conflict.  
This nation, now called **[[The Empire]]**, embarked on a new chapter: one of conquest and unification.

At first, their approach was cautious.  
They offered protection and aid to the weakened nations, inviting them to join the Empire in rebuilding and renewal.  
But diplomacy soon gave way to force.  
[[The Empire]] began to impose blockades, besiege cities, and coerce their neighbors to submit.

Over **86 years**, this gradual expansion transformed [[The Empire]] into a dominant force, uniting under its banner vast stretches of the continent.

_The next period is called: [[The Years of Consolidation]]_
