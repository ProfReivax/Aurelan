_The previous period is called: [[The Years of Consolidation]]


Then came a new conflict, more complex and brutal than before — a war involving three great powers: **[[Ael'Nathra]]**, **[[Noctharis]]**, and **[[The Empire]]** itself.  

This war raged for **14 years**, marked by fierce, relentless battles and frozen front lines.  
No side could gain the upper hand, leading to a strategic stalemate that dragged on painfully.

Each victory came at a heavy cost, each loss deepening the suffering of the people.  
The campaigns turned into exhausting marathons of attrition as resources dwindled and the will to fight waned.  
Civilian populations, caught in the crossfire, endured famine, displacement, and despair.  
The continent seemed to hold its breath, suspended in a fragile, unstable balance.

Eventually, worn down by the futility of endless conflict, the three nations agreed to a truce.  
The war ended, but the scars ran deep, and peace remained fragile, hanging by a thread.
