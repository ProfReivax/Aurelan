### 1. **Law of Meritocracy**
_Status is earned, not given._  
In [[Marcherion]], ancestry and noble birth mean nothing. This law exists to uphold the city’s core belief that only skill, courage, and achievement matter. It ensures that even the lowliest mercenary can rise through the ranks if they prove themselves. It also prevents old noble houses or foreign powers from buying influence in the city.  

**Consequence:** Anyone attempting to claim status by birthright will be publicly disgraced, lose all mercenary contracts for 1 year, and may be expelled from [[Marcherion]]. Such offenders face a prison sentence of up to 1 year and a fine of up to 500 gold coins.

### 2. **Law of the Contract**
_The spoken and written word are binding._  
Contracts are the lifeblood of [[Marcherion]]’s mercenary economy. Trust is rare, but a signed contract is sacred. This law enforces discipline and reliability, which keeps trade and war profitable and predictable. Broken contracts harm everyone by sowing chaos and mistrust.  

**Consequence:** Breaching a contract results in confiscation of property related to the agreement, a fine up to 2,500 gold coins, blacklisting from all guilds for 3 years, and possible exile. Imprisonment for up to 5 years may also be imposed depending on the severity.

_Disputes may be settled by sanctioned duels or arbitration, but violence outside these bounds is prohibited._

**Consequence:** Unauthorized violence carries imprisonment from 6 months to 5 years depending on severity, fines up to 1,000 gold coins, and suspension or permanent loss of mercenary licenses. Refusal of a sanctioned duel without cause results in loss of reputation and contract suspensions for up to 6 months.

### 4. **Law of Arms**
_Weapons must be sheathed within city walls unless on official duty or in sanctioned combat._  This law prevents chaos in the crowded streets, markets, and taverns. It protects civilians and merchants from sudden violence while still allowing mercenaries to be ready when called upon.  

**Consequence:** Violators face confiscation of weapons, fines ranging from 5 to 100 gold coins, imprisonment up to 6 months, and temporary suspension from mercenary work.

### 5. **Law of Loyalty**
_Loyalty to one’s employer or contract supersedes all._  
In a city where trust is scarce, loyalty is sacred. Betrayal not only endangers lives but also undermines the entire mercenary system. This law punishes treason and sabotage with the utmost severity.  

**Consequence:** Those found guilty of betrayal face imprisonment for 10 years to life, exile, or execution depending on the severity and nature of the offense.

### 6. **Law of Commerce**
_Trade and contracts are regulated to ensure fairness and opportunity._  
[[Marcherion]]’s economy depends on trade, supply lines, and mercenary contracts. This law ensures taxes fund city defenses and infrastructure while preventing corruption or monopolies.  

**Consequence:** Tax evasion or unregistered trade results in heavy fines up to 750 gold coins, confiscation of goods, and prohibition from trading within [[Marcherion]] for at least 2 years. Imprisonment for up to 1 years may be imposed in severe cases.

### 7. **Law of Religious Sanctity**
_Temples are sacred and must remain neutral grounds._  
Though the city is ruthless, the temples offer rare sanctuary and equality before the gods. This law protects these spaces from politics, violence, and mercantile schemes.  

**Consequence:** Violators risk fines up to 2,000 gold coins, imprisonment for up to 2 years, or excommunication from temple rites.

### 8. **Law of Public Order**
_Disorder, rioting, or unlawful assemblies are prohibited._  
With so many ambitious, armed individuals, maintaining peace is vital. The City Marshal enforces strict order to prevent chaos and maintain commerce.  

**Consequence:** Rioters and instigators face imprisonment from 1 to 10 years, fines up to 1,000 gold coins, and possible exile.

### 9. **Law of the Iron Concord**
_The decisions of the Iron Concord are final._  
Though secretive, the Concord is the ultimate authority in [[Marcherion]]. This law ensures their rulings are respected, preserving city stability.

**Consequence:** Defiance results in fines up to 10,000 gold coins, loss of all city privileges, imprisonment, or exile.

---
### 10. **Law of Citizenship**
_[[Marcherion Citizenship]] is earned through service and merit._  
Citizenship grants rights and privileges but must be earned through proving one’s worth to the city. This law protects the meritocratic ideal and controls the city’s population.  

**Consequence:** False claims lead to denial of city services, revocation of citizenship, expulsion, imprisonment for up to 1 year, and fines up to 3,000 gold coins.
