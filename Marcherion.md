## **Origin**

When the Empire began its relentless rise, swallowing neighboring nations with iron and fire, [[Kael Marcher]] found himself at a crossroads. His homeland, **[[Vhaloria]]**, once proud and free, had fallen under the Empire’s tightening grip. Unwilling to bow beneath a distant crown, Kael gathered his closest war companions—seasoned mercenaries, hardened veterans, and their families—and made a bold choice. Rather than submit or scatter, they would forge a new destiny with their own hands.  
Carving out a rugged stronghold between the warring powers of [[The Empire]] and [[Ael'Nathra]], they laid the foundations of Marcherion. Here, strength and honor were currency, and every soul’s worth was measured by their blade and resolve. It was not just a refuge, but a city born from defiance and ambition—a testament to those who refused to be ruled and chose instead to rule themselves.

## **Overview**

**Marcherion** is a city-state where wealth and strength alone determine your status. Bloodlines and titles mean nothing here — only what you can defend with a blade or buy with gold. Contracts are the city’s true currency: escorting caravans, assassinating rivals, protecting diplomats — all can make or break a person’s fortune. As the locals say, _“In Marcherion, your word is worth your steel.”_

Founded **156 years ago** by a wealthy mercenary named **[[Kael Marcher]]**, the city still bears his mark. His towering statue dominates [[The Concord Market]] — sword raised, gaze fixed on the horizon, a symbol of ambition and earned glory.

Though not a metropolis, Marcherion is a bustling crossroads. Its streets are lined with fortified stone houses, forges, mercenary guild halls, and ever-rowdy taverns. The city’s **university**, established by Kael and the first few [[Iron Concord]], trains not only soldiers and tacticians, but diplomats, alchemists, and war-scholars — for in Marcherion, intellect is just another weapon.

Despite its hardened reputation, the city hosts numerous **temples**, one for every god of the [[Pantheon of Auleran]]. Mercenaries leave offerings before campaigns, praying for profit and survival in equal measure.
## **Government**
[[Marcherion Government]] info

Marcherion is governed by the **Iron Concord**, a council of thirteen voices said to represent the city’s most powerful guilds and companies. Together, they decide on trade laws, military contracts, and the city’s overall direction — at least in theory.

To most citizens, the Concord feels distant and untouchable. Its meetings are closed, its votes are quiet, and its decrees arrive signed and sealed without much explanation. What’s known is that every three years, the **City Marshal** is chosen from among their ranks — a title part commander, part lawkeeper, and part public face. The current one, Commander Varek Thorne of the Iron Fangs, rules with firm discipline and little patience for disorder.

While the Concord claims to act for the good of all Marcherion, few expect generosity from them. The city’s real progress — its markets, temples, and neighborhoods — tends to come from the hands of those who live there. In Marcherion, people trust in their own strength and the work of their peers long before they trust in politics.

Locals often say:

> “The Concord builds walls. We build everything inside them.”


## **Culture and Daily Life**

Marcherion runs on steel and gold. Its people grow up learning to bargain, to fight, and to seize opportunity before someone else does. **Meritocracy** is an unspoken creed — worth is measured not by birth, but by one’s ability to survive and succeed.

Violence isn’t outlawed; it’s **regulated**. Disputes are often settled through sanctioned duels under the eyes of Concord arbiters. Refusing a duel marks one as weak — and in Marcherion, weakness is the only unforgivable sin. Yet beneath this ruthlessness lies a paradox: a city cold in its streets, but **united in its temples**.

Religion is the city’s only true source of **community**. While most relationships in Marcherion are transactional, the temples are sacred ground where all stand as equals before the **Principles**.  
Using faith for personal gain is deeply frowned upon — a betrayal of what little purity the city still holds. Within temple walls, weapons are laid aside, and ambition quiets. People come not to bargain, but to find peace, reflection, or perhaps forgiveness for what they’ve become outside.

Marcherion is one of the few places in the world to house **a temple to each of the Twelve Principles** of the [[Pantheon of Auleran]].
At night, the temples light up before the forges do — a reminder that despite its iron heart, Marcherion is not soulless. It is a city of warriors, merchants, and seekers — all striving, in their own way, for something greater than themselves.

## **Notable Landmarks**
- [[The Concord Market]] 
	The bustling heart of the city where contracts, goods, and secrets are traded alike. Surrounded entirely by the 13 Spires of the government complex, each representing a member of the Iron Concord. 
	Massive stone arches between the spires allow access, giving the impression that the market is both protected and watched at all times. 
	A statue of Kael Marcher towers at the market’s center, blade raised toward the horizon.

- [[The Iron Spires]] (The Iron Concord Hall) 
	The seat of Marcherion’s ruling council. Thirteen fortified towers joined by arched bridges, each housing one representative’s office and private chambers.

- [[The University of Marcherion]]
	Founded 147 years ago, shortly after the Concord’s creation.
	Renowned for its studies in warfare, diplomacy, and alchemy — the intellectual forge of Marcherion’s elite. 
	Scholars often double as tacticians or contract advisors to mercenary companies. Located just outside the Concord’s ring, symbolizing proximity to power without belonging to it.

- [[Kael’s Rest]] (The Inner Lake)
	A tranquil lake within the city walls, said to be where Kael Marcher once camped before the city’s founding.
	Locals gather here to relax, fish, and reflect — a rare place of calm within the city’s iron heart. 
	Hosts a smaller secondary market, selling food, crafts, and curiosities rather than contracts or arms.
