The **Concord Market** forms the living heart of Marcherion, ringed by the [[The Iron Spires]] of the Iron Concord. Between those towers, arched passageways lead into a sprawling, stone-paved district that hums with trade and tension. The air is thick with the scent of oil, parchment, and hot metal — the smell of business and coin.

### Atmosphere & Character

The Concord Market is **varied and dynamic**, a maze of streets lined with shops of all sizes. **Medium tent-like structures** sit beside **small, one-story stone or timber buildings**, creating a patchwork of commerce that feels alive and unplanned. Some streets host clusters of blacksmiths; others, scribes, enchanters, or curiosities. This variety gives the market its character: a place that feels busy, thriving, and slightly unpredictable.

The air is filled with the clink of coins, the hum of conversation, and the occasional call of a merchant advertising wares. Smells of leather, hot metal, and materials from distant lands mingle with the crisp tang of parchment and ink. Every transaction carries weight — deals are binding, promises are enforceable, and every merchant commands respect.
### What You Won’t Find

While gold and contracts flow freely, **food and drink** are strangely absent beyond taverns. Perishable goods are rarely traded here; such wares belong to the **markets of Kael’s Rest**, where citizens go to eat, relax, and escape the noise of commerce. In Marcherion, even hunger feels like business — but only at the Rest can one truly breathe.

### The Unspoken Rule

Violence within the Concord Market is strictly forbidden.  
The Iron Concord enforces this law with brutal efficiency: those caught drawing steel within its ring vanish within a day.  
Because of this, it’s one of the few places in the city where enemies can meet, speak, and even strike deals — under the ever-present shadow of the spires.

### Points of Interest

- **[[The Contract Wall]]**  
    Near **Kael Marcher’s statue**, a massive slab of marble lists **urgent and high-priority contracts**: mercenary missions with tight deadlines, dangerous escorts, bounty hunts with immediate risks. Posting on the Wall comes at a fee and is taken very seriously.
    
	Routine contracts and standard employment opportunities can instead be found through the **various guild halls and brokerage shops** scattered throughout the market, leaving the Wall for the tasks that demand speed, skill, and reputation.
    
    Tradition dictates that those about to accept a major contract from the Wall touch the hilt before signing, symbolizing the **weight of their word** and the seriousness of the task they are about to undertake.

- **[[The Silver Seat Tavern]]**  
	A corner tavern divided into three areas: a lively **bar** for socializing, a **main hall** for serious negotiations, and **private rooms** for secretive contracts. 
	Owned by **[[Mara Venn]]**, a respected retired mercenary, it serves as a hub for captains, brokers, and adventurers, where deals are struck, rumors exchanged, and respect is mandatory.
