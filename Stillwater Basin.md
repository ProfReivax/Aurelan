**Description:** A wide, placid freshwater lake with clear waters reflecting the sky and nearby buildings. It’s fed by a natural spring and small underground streams, making it one of the cleanest water sources in [[Marcherion]].

**Features:**

- Several wooden docks and fishing piers extend into the lake.

- Small rowboats and fishing skiffs are often moored here, used by local fishermen or merchants bringing goods via water routes.    
- Water lilies and aquatic plants cluster near the shores, attracting birds and small wildlife.

- Stone benches and shaded gazebos dot the perimeter, providing spots for relaxation and conversation.

- At night, bioluminescent algae sometimes glow faintly, giving the lake an ethereal shimmer.
### **Notable Spots Around the Lake**
